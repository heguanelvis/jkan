title: Detroit Department of Environmental Affairs
description: This division was originally established as Department of Environmental Affairs, in 1995 by executive reorganization and adopted by vote of the citizenry as a staff department in the 1997 charter revision referendum. As a result of the FY 10 â€“ 11 Budget, the Department of Environmental Affairs absorbed the Buildings and Safety Engineering Department creating the Buildings, Safety Engineering and Environmental Department (BSEED). The Charter empowers Environmental Affairs (EA) to administer, enforce, manage and coordinate environmental protection policies in the City of Detroit.
